# esp8266_LAN-WAN_access
It will allow user to control ESP8266 NodeMCU from Locally and Globally. 
Before starting with this project, I will recommend the user to go on https://arest.io/get-started for at least once.
After successfully getting such information in JSON format about client ID, device Name and Connection Status of ESP8266_NodeMCU, user can go ahead to use this .ino file for IoT operation.
When it comes to the function of Debounce Button, three testing points named as t1, t2 and t3 are there to monitor the ongoing loop while pressing FLASH button of ESP8266_NodeMCU. In my case, ESP8266_NodeMCU-Amica module is used.
For more information about NodeMCU, go to www.nodemcu.com .

For the SmartConfig functionality of ESP8266, use this Android App. Link,

Once SSID and Password is been taken via SmartConfig, user can also use Android App for LAN and WAN access.
[I developed my own MIT App with total four ON/OFF buttons, two for LAN and two for WAN. LAN IP address is been given to the App by user.] 

This repository will help the user to understand and implement different logics for projects involving IoT and Robotics tasks.
